# PWA-Weather-App

<h4>Main focus of this project is to understand about PWA Apps.</h4>

<h2>What is a PWA App and Why is it important?</h2>

<p>A PWA (Progressive Web App) is a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. What sets PWAs apart is their ability to offer a more app-like experience to users, including features like offline accessibility, push notifications, and device hardware access (like camera or geolocation) that were traditionally associated only with native mobile apps.

Key characteristics of PWAs include:

Progressive Enhancement: PWAs are designed to work for all users, regardless of browser choice, by using progressive enhancement principles. This means they should provide a baseline experience for all users, with advanced features available to those using modern browsers or devices.

Responsive: PWAs are built to be responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes and orientations, making them suitable for use on various devices, including smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers.

Connectivity Independent: PWAs can work offline or with a poor internet connection, thanks to technologies like service workers, which allow caching of assets and data for offline use.

App-Like Experience: PWAs often mimic the look and feel of native mobile apps, offering features like home screen icons, full-screen mode, and smooth animations to provide a more immersive user experience.

Discoverable: PWAs are discoverable through search engines and can be shared via URLs, just like regular websites, making them easy to find and distribute.

Installable: Users can install PWAs on their devices directly from the browser without going through app stores. This allows for a frictionless installation process and encourages user engagement.

Secure: PWAs must be served over HTTPS to ensure the security of data transmitted between the app and the server, as well as to enable the use of modern web features like service workers.</p>
